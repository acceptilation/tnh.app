# Who are we?

Hello there!

We're a [Church of the Redeemer][1] group of [20-][2] and [30-][3]somethings.
We meet every Thursday night at 7:30 and try to wrap up around 9:00, meeting at a home out in [Marietta][4],
northwest of Atlanta.

In 2023, we finished several study series.
[Know How We Got Our Bible][5] took us through the history of the Bible as a written text.
[The Jesus Paul Knew][6] encouraged us to view Jesus from different perspectives through the lens of Paul's letters.
We also completed a series of overviews of various Christian traditions: [Anglicans, Baptists, etc.][7]

In addition to studies, we also set aside the last Thursday of the month to do something different:
movie nights, dinners, etc.

Join us!
